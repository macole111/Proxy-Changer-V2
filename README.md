# History

![Original App](V1.JPG?raw=true "Original Application when used in a School")

This project was created in 2010 to allow people to easily configure their Proxy Settings from the System Tray. In one environment, users would take their laptops home and have to disable the Proxy in order to connect to the VPN.

Since it's inception, this was downloaded over 50,000 times on SourceForge where it was hosted before (https://sourceforge.net/projects/proxychangerwin/)
